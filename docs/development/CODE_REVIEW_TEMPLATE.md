## URMS-OS Architecture Review

### 1. Dependency Direction
- [ ] `core/` has no `infrastructure/` imports
- [ ] Domain entities have no external dependencies
- [ ] Interfaces defined in `core/ports/`

### 2. "No Vendor Lock-in"  
- [ ] External services behind interfaces
- [ ] Provider selection via configuration
- [ ] Data export/import capabilities
- [ ] No hardcoded endpoints/keys

### 3. Testing Strategy
- [ ] Contract tests for interfaces
- [ ] Unit tests for business logic
- [ ] Integration tests for adapters

### 4. Configuration
- [ ] Provider config in standard format
- [ ] Secrets via environment variables
- [ ] Multiple provider support

## Review Result:
✅ COMPLIANT | ⚠️ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT | ❌ ARCHITECTURE VIOLATION
